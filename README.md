# Accenture_Data_Analytics_and_Visualization
Delve into the dynamic world of data analytics and visualization with Navigating Numbers virtual internship. This immersive program offers an in-depth exploration of data essentials, encompassing data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and storytelling.

## Introduction
Social Buzz is a rapidly expanding technology unicorn in need of swift adaptation to its large scale global operations.
Accenture is conducting a 3-month POC centered on the following objectives:
+ An audit of big data practice
+ Recommendations for a successful IPO
+ Analysis to find Social Buzz's top 5 most popular categories of content

## Task 1: Project Understanding
Quickly get up to speed with the business problem being addressed, project requirements and team alignment.

Read the brief from Social Buzz to:
+ Understand the client and business problem at hand.
+ Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
+ Identify which tasks to focus on as a Data Analyst.

Read the internal stakeholders chart to better understand the roles & responsibilities of the team.
As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked with the analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.


## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling
Modeling data to create valuable insights.

Read & understood the data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer the business question: 
Top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

Cleaned the data by:
+ Removing rows that have values which are missing,
+ Changing the data type of some values within a column, and
+ Removing columns which are not relevant to this task.

Created a final data set by merging three tables together : Reaction, Content, & Reaction Types data sets.
Performed data modeling by merging the three data sets, using the VLOOKUP formula.
Figured out the Top 5 performing categories aggregating the total scores by category, using the SUMIF formula

## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling
Brought the data to life and extracted valuable insights for the business. Built a PowerPoint presentation to organize the findings on Social Buzz's content performance. Using PivotTables, created data charts that effectively illustrate the data analysis.
Some of the interesting insights that was shared include:

+ How many unique categories are there?
+ How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
+ What was the month with the most posts?
